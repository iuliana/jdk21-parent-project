=== JEP 431. Sequenced Collections

Javaâ€™s collections framework lacks a collection type that represents a sequence of elements with a defined encounter order. It also lacks a uniform set of operations that apply across such collections.

For example, `List` and `Deque` both define an encounter order but their common supertype is Collection, which does not.

Similarly, `Set` does not define an encounter order, and subtypes such as `HashSet` do not define one, but subtypes such as `SortedSet` and `LinkedHashSet` do.

Enter the `SequencedCollection<E>` interface.
