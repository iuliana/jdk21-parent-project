=== JEP 444. Virtual Threads

 Virtual threads are lightweight threads that dramatically reduce the effort of writing, maintaining, and observing high-throughput concurrent applications.

* Designed to replace reactive code.
* Virtual threads allow programming in the familiar, sequential thread-per-request style.
* Sequential code is not only easier to write and read but also easier to debug since we can use a debugger to trace the program flow step by step, and stack traces reflect the expected call stack.
* Writing scalable applications with sequential code is made possible by allowing many virtual threads to share a platform thread (the name given to the conventional threads provided by the operating system).
* When a virtual thread has to wait or is blocked, the platform thread will execute another virtual thread.
* The best part is that we donâ€™t have to change existing Java code.

 A virtual thread can be created in two ways:

Here are 1000 platform threads processing 1000 tasks and adding their results:

How many virtual threads can I run on my machine? (The app will still run, computer will still run. The only way to know that something went wrong is to check the GC logs and notice memory is not being freed and no new threads are not created. Yes, a new kind of hell!)

IMPORTANT: Since they are so lightweight, there is no need to pool them. You need a thread, just create one.

IMPORTANT: Virtual threads are designed to model a _single task_, rather than a mechanism for running tasks.

IMPORTANT: Virtual threads are transparently suspended/resumed when they block. The Blocking API throughout the JDK has been retrofitted to be aware of virtual threads.

One of my goals for my own personal work with JAVA 21 is - So, how can this be broken? Because everything breaks sooner or later and would be nice to have a heads-up.
